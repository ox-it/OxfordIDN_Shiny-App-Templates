<h1>About Page</h1>

<p>This description can contain arbitrary HTML, for instance the p tags used around this text.</p>

<p>Code can be included inline using backticks, for instance here `r 2+2` is written to compute 2+2: 4. This is useful for providing information about the data included in the visualisation, for instance the observation that the data in this visualisation has 15 rows in it.</p>

<p>Because the code above is dependent on objects defined in the server, this .Rmd file is rendered server side using `includeHTML` and then displayed in the ui.R file via `uiOutput`.</p>

<p>It is good practice to link to both the data underlying a visualisation (this <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3425729">Figshare deposit</a>) and the <a href=https://github.com/martinjhnhadley/OxfordIDN_Shiny-App-Templates/Layouts/navbarMenu">Github Repository</a>

<p>Images are also easy to include, the Oxford IT Services logo has been shown below. It is contained within the following directory; www/images. Shiny sets the /www folder as the base directory for relative links.</p>
